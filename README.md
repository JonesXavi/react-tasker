# React Tasker - Task Manager

This project is a simple Task Manager, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

App Demo in [Tasker](https://jonesxavi.github.io/react-tasker/).

Note: I used [My Json Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) to use fetch my own [JSON](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jonesxavi/react-tasker), so the changes aren't persisted when you refresh.

## What's the take away from this ? 

The Latest React 17 Duh! - Getting the basics right.\
[Json Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) Package - A full fake REST API.\
[React Day Time Picker](https://react-day-time-picker.netlify.app/) Package - React component to help with scheduling a day and time.
